# RPS - Subgraph


## Setup
First, ensure that you have deployed [the project's contracts](../contracts/).

Install the dependencies
```bash
pnpm i
```

Prepare the configuration for the deployment
```bash
pnpm prepare
```

Now we're ready to create and deploy our subgraph:

```bash
pnpm graph:create
pnpm graph:deploy
```
